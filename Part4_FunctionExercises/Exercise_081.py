Exercise 81: Compute the Hypotenuse

    Write a function that takes the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right triangle as
    its parameters. Return the hypotenuse of the triangle, computed using Pythagorean
    theorem, as the functionâ€™s result. Include a main program that reads the lengths of
    the shorter sides of a right triangle from the user, uses your function to compute the
    length of the hypotenuse, and displays the result.
