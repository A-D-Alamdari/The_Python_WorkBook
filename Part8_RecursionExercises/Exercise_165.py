Exercise 165: Greatest Common Divisor

    Euclid was a Greek mathematician who lived approximately 2,300 years ago. His
    algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two positive integers, a and
    b, is both efficient and recursive. It is outlined below:

        If b is 0 then
            Return a
        Else
            Set c equal to the remainder when a is divided by b
            Return the greatest common divisor of b and c

    Write a program that implements Euclidâ€™s algorithm and uses it to determine the
    greatest common divisor of two integers entered by the user.
