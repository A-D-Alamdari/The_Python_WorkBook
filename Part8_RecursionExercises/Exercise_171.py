Exercise 171: Spelling with Element Symbols

    Each chemical element has a standard symbol that is one, two or three letters long.
    One game that some people like to play is to determine whether or not a word can
    be spelled using only element symbols. For example, silicon can be spelled using
    the symbols Si, Li, C, O and N. However, hydrogen can not be spelled with any
    combination of element symbols.
    Write a recursive function that determines whether or not a word can be spelled
    using only element symbols. Your function will take two parameters: the word that
    you are trying to spell and a list of the symbols that can be used. Your function will
    return two results: a Boolean value indicating whether or not a spelling was found,
    and the string of symbols used to achieve the spelling (or an empty string if no spelling
    exists). Your function should ignore capitalization when searching for a spelling.
    Create a program that uses your function to find and display all of the element
    names that can be spelled using only element symbols. Display the names of the ele-
    ments along with the sequences of symbols. For example, one line of your output
    will be:

    Silver can be spelled as SiLvEr

    Your program will use the elements data set, which can be downloaded from the
    authorâ€™s website. This data set includes the names and symbols of all 118 chemical
    elements.
