Exercise 15: Distance Units

    In this exercise, you will create a program that begins by reading a measurement
    in feet from the user. Then your program should display the equivalent distance in
    inches, yards and miles. Use the Internet to look up the necessary conversion factors
    if you donâ€™t have them memorized.
