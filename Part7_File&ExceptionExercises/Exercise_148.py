Exercise 148:Sum a List of Numbers

    Create a program that sums all of the numbers entered by the user while ignoring
    any lines entered by the user that are not valid numbers. Your program should dis-
    play the current sum after each number is entered. It should display an appropriate
    error message after any invalid input, and then continue to sum any additional num-
    bers entered by the user. Your program should exit when the user enters a blank
    line. Ensure that your program works correctly for both integers and floating point
    numbers.
    Hint: This exercise requires you to use exceptions without using files.
